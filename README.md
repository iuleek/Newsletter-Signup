# Newsletter-Signup
This is the way the page looks when I'm on glitch
![newsletter](https://github.com/iuleek/Newsletter-Signup/assets/116274656/a4592ec7-1239-4d91-a77f-95ec6a23edef)
If the user didn't previously subscribed this the success page
![success](https://github.com/iuleek/Newsletter-Signup/assets/116274656/63bab893-b953-4de1-9d57-7d33e3d2b6cd)
And this is the error page wich means the email doesn't have the correct structure or the person already subscribed.
